# Datality
My name is Kamran and I am data science enthusiast. I have decided to start this blog in order to share my experience of learning data science, as well as projects I have done throughout this journey. Having said that I am still actively learning and doing various data driven projects and this blog is where I plan to share that process. I appreciate feedback, thus if you have any thoughts on improving it or changing things please get in touch.
The blog will also serve a role of helping me keep track of content I have learned or explored in my quest of becoming a data scientist.
